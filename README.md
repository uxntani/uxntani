# Hello there👋

## About me ✒️
- I’m a B.Tech CSE student specializing in AI & ML, and I’m steadily building a strong foundation in programming, web development, and core computer science concepts. I’ve worked on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects, and I’m also exploring Python for data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving. 
- I have hands-on experience with topics like linked lists, trees, and basic circuit theorems, along with a growing interest in UI/UX design.
- My approach is practical and curiosity-driven—I like to dive into concepts, break them down, and figure out how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.
